It's a small app that lives on your menubar and allows you to move/resize your windows
using keyboard shortcuts.

### Isn't it another keyboard-shortcut app?

**No!** I never liked those apps cause it's not natural to move your windows around without the mouse, at least not when you wanna move them to a random place (not just "left or right").

The keyboard shortcuts in Swift Shift are meant to be hold while you move the mouse, so it's like you're dragging the window with your mouse but without clicking anything. That way you **don't need to find those tiny arrows and title bars anymore**.

### Open source

The app is open source and you can find it on [pablopunk/SwiftShift](https://github.com/pablopunk/swiftshift) or directly download it on [swiftshift.app](https://swiftshift.app).


### Help me test it

I'm also planning on releasing it on the App Store, so if you wanna help me test it, you can go ahead and [download it now](https://swiftshift.app) before the final version hits the store.
