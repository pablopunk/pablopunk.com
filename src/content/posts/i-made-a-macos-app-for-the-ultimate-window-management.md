It's a small app that lives on your menubar and allows you to move/resize your windows
using keyboard shortcuts.

### Isn't it another keyboard-shortcut app?

**No!** I never liked those apps cause it's not natural to move your windows around without the mouse, at least not when you wanna move them to a random place (not just "left or right").

The keyboard shortcuts in Swift Shift are meant to be held while you move the mouse, so it's like you're dragging the window with your mouse but without clicking anything. That way you **don't need to find those tiny arrows and title bars anymore**.

### Get it!

You can get the app [swiftshift.app](https://swiftshift.app), it's a pay-what-you-want download. If you just wanna try it, go ahead and get the [latest release](https://github.com/pablopunk/SwiftShift/releases) on GitHub **for free**.
